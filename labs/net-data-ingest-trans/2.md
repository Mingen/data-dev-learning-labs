Below steps are describing the process of packaging and runing the sample program. 

b) Select the <b>package</b> and click on <b>Blue</b> button to build. 
   After successful build process, change it to <b>run</b> and then click on <b>Blue</b> button again.

* USER: your current login user name </br>
<b>N.B</b> Enter your login userid. If you login as user_1 then enter user_1 here as USER. </br>
* INPUT: The file name in “Data Repository” section which you want to transform. </br>
<b>N.B:</b> Sample preloaded network data is already saved in HDFS environment. User can use this file for learning purpose. </br>
* OUTPUT: The output file name that your code will generate.  </br>
<b>N.B</b> Enter any name as an output file name. For example, testFile1.csv is used as a output file name. Output of the program would be saved in this file and the file would be saved in Hadoop environment directly. 

b)	Choose a Command run under Edit Commands, then click the blue button
