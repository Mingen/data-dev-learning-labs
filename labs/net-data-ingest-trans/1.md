# Network Data Ingestion and Transformation

A data collection server, shown in the diagram below, is collecting data in real time from the local network. The data collected by the Server is working with a Client residing in DLP to transfer the network data collected through Kafka. Using Kafka socket code, we are making a connection to the client and capture the network data and send it to a Kafka topic. From this topic, data will be moved to HDFS by a Consumer program. With the data present in HDFS, we can then further transform it using our program and visualize the data before and after the transformation in different chart format such as pie chart, bar chart etc. using Tableau tool. The diagram shows how exactly network data flows from a local network through Kafka in HDFS and gets transformed.

In this lab, the network stream will be pre-created, so it will be available live in the platform for access. The steps for creating a network stream is described below. User doesnâ€™t need to operate these to create a stream.

# Lab Objectives

*	How to ingest a network stream in DLP Platform
*	How to get network data from the HDFS. 
*	Learn the process of transform network data by creating a transform function using IDE
* Learn how to save a file to HDFS and visualize data

# Prerequisites

*	Knowledge on Hadoop to store the network data.
*	Studied platform user guide.
*	Basic knowledge of how spark works.
*	Use of Chrome OS

# Lab Settings

"Data Repository" section is allowing you to create network real-time data stream. Kafka's producer will push the Network traffic generated data to Kafka cluster and Consumer will consume that data and save that into HDFS in real-time.
From HDFS, we can visualize the data using visualization tool. This application will allow you to use the existing Kafka's Producer & Consumer function to ingest your real time network data into HDFS environment.

<b>N.B.</b> DLP platform provide a default Kafka's Producer, Consumer and Network traffic generator. User can select there own network data and use DLP provided Kafka's component to process the network data. User can define and deploy their own service also.
